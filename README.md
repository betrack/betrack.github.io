# Betrack Landing Page
Basic boilerplate with Gulp, Sass, Browsersync and a couple more stuff. 

## Installation
1. Don't use `master` branch for anything, it will be use to serve all the files for the Github Page.
2. Use `sergio-landing` (we need to change it or rename it in the future).
3. Run some commands:
4. `npm install`

5. `gulp` (for development, includes browsersyn + watch + livereload).

6. Make changes or updates.

7. `gulp build` (builds in dist/ folder).

8. `gulp deploy` (this will update everything, make a commit and push it to `master`).
